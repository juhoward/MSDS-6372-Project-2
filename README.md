Introduction
There are two main objectives for Project 2
  
Objective 1
Display the ability to perform EDA and build a logistic regression model
•	Perform your logistic regression analysis and provide interpretation of the regression coefficients including hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals. For simplicity sake, you do not need to include interactions with this model. Comment on the  practical vs statistical significance of the deemed important factors.
  
Objective 2
•	With a simple logistic regression model as a baseline, perform additional competing models to improve on prediction performance metrics.  Which metrics are up to you and your given data set.
